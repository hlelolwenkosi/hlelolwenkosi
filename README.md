Iâ€™m a dedicated software development graduate from Codespace Academy, where I focus on front-end development and am passionate about creating engaging, interactive web experiences.
My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and Iâ€™m constantly exploring new frameworks and technologies to expand my skill set.

ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning:** Iâ€™m delving into advanced JavaScript concepts, experimenting with popular libraries like React and Vue.js,and learning about modern CSS techniques for responsive design. 
Iâ€™m also enhancing my skills in data analysis to better understand how to leverage data for making informed decisions and improving user experiences.

ðŸ’ž **Collaborations:** Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on projects that blend web development and data analysis. 
Whether itâ€™s building a dynamic web application, analyzing data to uncover trends, or contributing to open-source projects, 
Iâ€™m excited about opportunities that challenge me and allow me to grow as a developer. If you have a project or an idea youâ€™d like to work on together, letâ€™s connect!

ðŸ“« **How to Reach Me:** You can reach me via [1071hf@gmail.com] or connect with me on [www.linkedin.com/in/hlelo-ndwandwe-8751962ab].

âš¡ **Fun Fact:** While I thrive on coding and problem-solving, Iâ€™m not a fan of design work. I prefer to concentrate on the functionality and performance of applications rather than their visual aspects.
Despite this, I appreciate the role design plays in creating a seamless user experience!
